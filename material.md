### Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

* https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

This is a book that I love because helps us to "think in a more programmatic way" by automating real problems.

From chapter 0 to 10 are good chapters to understand most of the Python basics data types and internal methods/functions that are useful to grow from there and be able to understand or have an idea about how bigger external modules or libraries could behave internally.


### Official Python Tutorial

* https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

This tutorial is good for new people coming into the programming world.

Chapters 1 to 9 are basic Python concepts (similar to the ones from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, but maybe not too fun as that book). I think chapters 4 and 5 are very important.

Chapters 10 and 11 are very good to know what kind of functions are already available in the standard library (comes with Python itself) and could give us a good view about what we can do with Python by combining these utilities.


### Python Data Science Handbook

This book is directly related to what you are doing at Juanlu's classes. So, it's a little bit more advanced but I really like the way the author explains the concepts.

I think that chapter 1 and 3 are more related with what we need to work at this moment.
